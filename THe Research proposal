The Research Proposal
	The problem is we do not know which phrase is more effective “Give in to your anger” or “Together we can rule the galaxy”.  Coverting people to the dark side is very important for Sith as recruitment is important for any organization and we should attempt to see which phrase is more effective.  
	We should try to find which phrase has more successful outcomes in regards to recruitment. One way to do this is to have Vader, Palpatine and other less powerful people use these different phrases around different groups and see what the results are.  We could construct a grid that shows audience group, speaker and phrase to conduct these tests and essentially run several small studies and the measure the results as if it were a metastudy and see what our outcomes are.

1)	Two versions would be people with the supplement and people with a placebo. 
The two groups would be randomly assigned and preferably double blind,
the people taking the supplement and the people handing them out would have no idea if the person was receiving the treatment or placebo.  Out hypothesis is the supplement will help people sleep. The outcome would be whether or not the supplement was better than the placebo.

2)	We could pull data regarding the gym from the past and attempt to use that data as a control group and compare it to
how things change when the employees have uniforms.  This is assuming we only have one gym to work with.
Our sample will depend on if we only have one gym or multiple gyms.
Due to the difficulty of getting thousands of gyms to agree to something like this we 
will not be able to create a large sample size. Our hypothesis is that the uniforms will increase new
customers and retention. The outcome will be whether or not it worked

3)	Similar to above in that we have one business page and will have to look at previous data to create 
a control group and our experimental group will be the websites metrics after the new page is set up.

4)	Looking at the old response rate vs new response rate. Hypothesis is please read will help increase views.
